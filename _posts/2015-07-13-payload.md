The JSON Payload to use for starting Cloud Transcode activities is detailed below.

### Examples

You can find simple example of working payload in the CPE project under `client_example/input_samples/`. Those examples work with CT and perform basic transcodings.

### How it works

Your client application sends your JSON Payload through your SQS input queue. Your client app must respect a specific format that is understood by the CT activities.
