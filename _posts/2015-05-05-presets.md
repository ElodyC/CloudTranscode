Presets are small JSON snippets that can be used in your JSON input jobs.

When transcoding videos, you must specify a preset.

All presets are located in a separate GitHub project here: https://github.com/sportarchive/CloudTranscode-FFMpeg-presets

Feel free to submit pull requests to add more presets or update the existing ones.
