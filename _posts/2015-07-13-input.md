The `input_asset` field reference the input file that needs transcoding. CT supports two sources:

   * S3 Bucket/File
   * HTTP/HTTPS accessible file

### S3 File

To reference a file located on AWS S3, use the following format:

```json
"input_asset": {
    "type": "VIDEO",
    "bucket": "cloudtranscode-dev",
    "file": "/input/video1.mp4"
}
```

**Details:**

   - **type**: VIDEO or IMAGE (no other types are yet supported)
   - **bucket**: S3 bucket name
   - **file**: S3 key to file in bucket

> You must provide this entry to all activities so they know which asset they need to download from S3 and process.

Based on the `type' the proper Transcoder will be started for you: ImageTranscoder or VideoTranscoder. 

### HTTP/HTTPS file

To reference a file over HTTP use the following format:

```json
"input_asset": {
   "type": "VIDEO",
   "http": "[URL]"
}
```

This is a very efficient of transcoding videos. With this method, there is no need to pre-download the asset locally in the /tmp folder. FFmpeg will download the file and transcode on the fly for you. You will save precious time.

> This only works for the VIDEO type as FFMpeg supports the HTTP protocol. For IMAGE type, you must specify a bucket and key.
