We're going to get started with a simple video transcoding workflow: one video input and one output.

### Requirements

Before anything, you need to have the CPE stack installed and configured properly to load the Cloud Transcoding activities.

So head to the CPE documentation page and follow the "GET STARTED" section to have a running stack: http://sportarchive.github.io/CloudProcessingEngine/start/introduction.html

> Only once you have setup CPE and understand how it works you should go further in this documentation

### Plan

The CPE decider loads a Plan.yml that you need to write. If you followed the CPE "GET STARTED" documentation your decider should be running the CT example plan (ct_plan_simple.yml) that we will use for this example. You should have edited it to reference your own Video files in AWS S3.

**See this plan here:** http://sportarchive.github.io/CloudProcessingEngine/comp/decider.html#decider-plan

**This plan contains couple steps:**

   - **ValidateAssetStep**: Processed by activity `ValidateAsset` version `v2`
   - **TranscodeAssetStep**: Processed by activity `TranscodeAsset` version `v2`

{% raw %}
As input for the first step, we use the worflow input data. `{{__input__}}` is a keyword that references the Workflow input payload your client app sent when starting the job.
{% endraw %}

For the second step, we craft a specific input to match the `TranscodeAsset` activity requirements. We include data from the workflow payload and also the output of `ValidateAssetStep`.

Each activities expect and accept a certain JSON format. We detail their requirements later in this documentation.

### Checklist

{% raw %}
At this point you should have running:

   - **Decider:** Using a custom plan or the ct_plan_simple.yml example we provided
   - **InputPoller:** Listening to your SQS **input** queue
   - **ctivityPoller (ValidateAsset):** One worker for probing assets and listening to the proper Activity TaskList (by default it is set by the Decider as: `activity_name`-`activity_version`).
   - **ActivityPoller (TranscodeAsset):** One worker for transcoding assets and listening to the proper Activity TaskList (by default it is set by the Decider as: `activity_name`-`activity_version`).

For testing you should also have the two client_example scripts started as well. See: http://sportarchive.github.io/CloudProcessingEngine/start/use-the-stack.html

> Now you can transcode things. If you followed the CPE Getting Started you should be fine.
