We're going to get started with a simple video transcoding workflow: one video input and one output.

### Requirements

Before anything, you need to have the CPE stack installed and configured properly to load the Cloud Transcoding activities.

So head to the CPE documentation page and follow the "GET STARTED" section to have a running stack: http://sportarchive.github.io/CloudProcessingEngine/start/introduction.html

> Only once you have setup CPE and understand how it works you should go further in this documentation

### Plan

The CPE decider loads a Plan.yml that you need to write. If you followed the CPE "GET STARTED" documentation your decider should be running the CT example plan (ct_plan_simple.yml) that we will use for this example. You should have edited it to reference your own Video files in AWS S3.

The plan looks as follow:

{% raw %}
```yaml
---
name: "Transcode"   # WF name in SWF
version: "1.0"      # WF version in SWF
input_spec:
  type: object

# Listing Steps
steps:
  - name: "ValidateAssetStep"
    activity: "ValidateAsset"    # The pass the entire Workflow input payload to this step
    input: |
      {{__input__}}             

  - name: "TranscodeAssetStep"
    activity: "TranscodeAsset"
    requires:
      - ["ValidateAssetStep", 'succeeded']
    input: |
      {
        "client": {{__input__.client}},
        "input_asset": {{__input__.input_asset}},
        "input_asset_metadata": {{ValidateAssetStep.metadata}},
        "output_asset": {{__input__.output_asset}}
      }
      
# Listing activities
activities:
  - name: "ValidateAsset"       # Activity name in SWF
    version: "v2"
    input_spec:                 # JSON-Schema input validation
      type: object
    outputs_spec:
      metadata: "$"             # WE return `metadata` in output. It contains the result data from the activity `$`

  - name: "TranscodeAsset"      # Activity name in SWF
    version: "v2"
    input_spec:                 # JSON-Schema input validation
      type: object
    outputs_spec: ~
```
{% endraw %}

**This plan contains couple steps:**

   - **ValidateAssetStep**: Processed by activity `ValidateAsset` version `v2`
   - **TranscodeAssetStep**: Processed by activity `TranscodeAsset` version `v2`

As input for the first step, we use the worflow data and input value in it `{{__input__}}`. {{__input__}} is a keyword that reference the Workflow input payload that you client app sent when starting the job.

For the second step, we craft a specific input to match the `TranscodeAsset` activity requirements. We include the some data from the workflow payload and also the output of `ValidateAssetStep`.

You can start as many workflow as you want in parallel.
