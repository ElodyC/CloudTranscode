You need an AWS account to run the stack.
The clients using the stack need an AWS account too.

For the purpose of this "Getting started" documentation, we will run both the Stack and one Client within the same AWS account.

You could do that in production too, but it is recommended to segregate the Stack and the clients in separate AWS account.

### AWS entitlements

You must create a privileged user on your AWS account. Give it "admin" rights so it can use any resources.

Save its KEY and SECRET.

### S3 entitlements & bucket

As the same privileged user will run both the Stack and the Clients, there is no entitments to setup.

Create two buckets in S3:

   - An input bucket
   - An output bucket

Use the name you want. They must be unique to the S3 platform.

### SQS queues

Again no entitments are necessary for this.

Create Two SQS queues:

   - An input queue
   - And output queue

Use the name you want. Those queues will be used for communications between the stack and the client.
